## Architecture vision of the build system

### Requirements

+ the build system is simple, transparent, easy to understand and not complex.
+ the build system is defined by simple explicit rules.
+ a feature (aka submodule, component, package) is fully described by its Manifest.
+ the Manifest declares all parts belonging to the feature.
+ the Manifest declares all dependencies of the feature to other local or remote features and modules.
+ the incremental build step, builds everything what is required, but not more then that.
